# Introduction
## What is the "Medical Education Course Compass"
The "Medical Education Course Compass" results from a research project conducted in Switzerland. Our research presented an exemplary approach to cataloguing medical education courses and their content using a free and open-access methodology. It sought to improve the clarity and availability of information about medical education offerings through a standardized and interactive presentation.

### Methods
A research paper (link following upon publication) will explain our research methods and their application in the Swiss context.

### Results
Our findings detail the diversity and accessibility challenges of medical education courses in Switzerland, highlighting the innovative solution provided by our Obsidian-based platform, [compass.siwf.ch](compass.siwf.ch). 

## What is this repository?
This repository serves as a template for potential adaptors to base similar efforts to ours. We strive for transparency and accessibility, which is why we created this template for easy adoption into the tools we also utilized ([Obsidian.md](obsidian.md) and [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)). However, given the loose nature of our "database" being Markdown files, this repository can also be a starting point for use with any other tool.

## Features
* Interactive Course Database: Obsidian lets you structure and assess your course data interactively. This is a helpful and accessible method for browsing qualitative data, such as course information.
* Competence and Keyword Mapping: Mapping specific competencies to individual courses as their own keywords represented as Markdown files, viewable through Obsidian's graph visualization feature and hover functionality, allows for a clear and accessible method of mapping competencies to courses and vice versa.
* Multilingual Support: Obsidian's alias functionality allows for the use of this template in multilingual settings.
* Open Access: The database structure and content are freely accessible under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

## Using This Repository
This repository provides templates and documentation for researchers and educators interested in replicating or building upon our methodology and platform.

## Working with the Compass
Guidelines on how to use the templates, adapt the competence mapping, and utilize the graph visualization features are provided, ensuring users can effectively navigate and contribute to the project. Refer to each template file for competencies (keywords) and courses.
